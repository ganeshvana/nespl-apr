Request For Quotation Portal - RFQ  Portal
============================================
-   This module allows vendors to search through all of Odoo's RFQs and Purchase Orders. 
    For example, after adding buy lines, a purchase RFQ can be generated for the vendor, 
    and once the state is changed to Sent, the vendor portal user can access the order/document. 
    On line products, vendors can change the unit pricing. They can also use the Accept and 
    Sign option to complete the RFQ.

Installation
========================
- Copy rfq_vendor_portal module to addons folder
- Install the module normally like other modules.
